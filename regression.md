Regression
===


####**Guass-Newton Method**

for solving non-linear mean-square


####**Gradient Descent Method** (steepest descent)

####**Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm**

the combination of steepest descent and Guass-Newton method
when the solution is far from correct, it behaves like steepest descent method, slow but guarantee to converge
when its close, it behaves like guass-newton method
