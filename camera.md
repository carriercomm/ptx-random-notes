Principles of Camera
===

the design of camera essentially is an improvement upon pinhole camera

limitations of pinhole camera have 

- a smaller pinhole can reduce blurring, but causes a darker image 
- diffraction limit

Lenses
---


Diaphragm
---
measured as f-number (f1.1 ~ f22), greater f-number means smaller diaphragm
determines amount of light enters through the lenses

Shutter
---
measured as fraction of a second
determines time of exposure

CCD (Charge Coupled Device)
---
consists of photosites, which turns light to charge(analogue)
